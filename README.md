# TypeClasses

This project contains some experiments to model an oo inheritance hierarchy (as in Java 8 with Interfaces and Default Methods) with Haskell Type Classes.

The code revolves around simple stack an queue implementations.
These implementations are not meant as robust libraries but rather to give a small framework to experiment with type classes.
